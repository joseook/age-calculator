# Age Calculator

The Age Calculator is a simple application that calculates age based on the provided date of birth. The application provides information about age in years, months, and days.

## How to Use

## Input Checks

The application performs checks on the input fields to ensure that the entered data is valid:

- **Day:**
  - Should be a number between 1 and 31.

- **Month:**
  - Should be a number between 1 and 12.

- **Year:**
  - Should be a positive number with at least 4 digits.

If the entered data does not meet these criteria, an alert will be displayed, and the relevant input fields will be highlighted in red.
